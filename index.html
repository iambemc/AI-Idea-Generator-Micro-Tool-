    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Subtle Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is a functional micro-tool designed to demonstrate value. It has a simple, three-part structure: 1) A clear header explaining the tool's purpose. 2) An input section with two dropdowns for user selection (Business Type, Goal). 3) A dynamic output section where tailored ideas are generated. 4) A lead-capture form that appears after value is provided. This task-oriented design is intuitive and showcases both development and marketing strategy skills. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Input Form (Interaction): Standard HTML dropdowns for user input.
        - Dynamic Content Blocks (Inform): JS dynamically creates and populates styled HTML cards for each idea, demonstrating DOM manipulation.
        - Lead Capture Form (Interaction): A conditional form appears after idea generation, offering to email the results. This demonstrates an understanding of marketing funnels and value exchange.
        - Justification: This approach directly proves the user's ability to build functional tools that provide value and generate leads, which is more impactful for a developer/strategist profile.
