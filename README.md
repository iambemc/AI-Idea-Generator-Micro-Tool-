Core Features
This is not just a static webpage; it's a dynamic single-page application with three key features:

Curated Idea Generation: The tool contains a built-in database of proven, high-quality marketing strategies. Users can select their business type and primary goal to receive a set of 5 tailored, curated ideas.

Live AI Integration: The "Generate with Live AI" feature connects directly to the Google Gemini API. It constructs a detailed, well-engineered prompt based on the user's selections and generates five completely new, unique marketing ideas in real-time.

Lead-Capture System: After providing value, a lead-capture form appears. It offers to send the generated ideas to the user and is configured to open the user's default email client with a pre-addressed message, demonstrating a practical understanding of marketing funnels.

Tech Stack
This project was built from scratch using a modern, lightweight tech stack:

HTML5: For the core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: For a responsive, utility-first design system.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all DOM manipulation, event handling, and application logic.

Google Gemini API: For the live AI idea generation feature, accessed via a fetch request.

Purpose & Value
The goal of this project is to move beyond a traditional resume or portfolio and provide tangible proof of skill. It demonstrates:

Full-Stack Thinking: The ability to architect a solution from the ground up, from UI/UX design to frontend logic and API integration.

Problem-Solving: The tool directly addresses a common pain point for small businesses: a lack of marketing ideas.

Modern Development Skills: It showcases proficiency in building responsive, interactive web applications with modern tools and APIs.
