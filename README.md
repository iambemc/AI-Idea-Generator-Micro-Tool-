Core Features
This is not just a static webpage; it's a dynamic single-page application with three key features:

Curated Idea Generation: The tool contains a built-in database of proven, high-quality marketing strategies. Users can select their business type and primary goal to receive a set of 5 tailored, curated ideas.

Live AI Integration: The "Generate with Live AI" feature is coded to connect directly to the Google Gemini API. It constructs a detailed, well-engineered prompt based on the user's selections to generate unique marketing ideas.

Lead-Capture System: After providing value, a lead-capture form appears. It offers to send the generated ideas to the user and is configured to open the user's default email client with a pre-addressed message, demonstrating a practical understanding of marketing funnels.

A Note on the 'Live AI' Feature
The "Generate with Live AI" button is designed to demonstrate the ability to integrate with a live AI model. For security reasons, the necessary API key is not included in this public repository. Therefore, clicking this button on the live demo will show a friendly error message.

This is the correct and expected behavior. The feature successfully showcases the code and logic required to connect to a live AI, which is the primary goal of this portfolio piece. The "Generate Curated Ideas" button remains fully functional for demonstrating the tool's core experience.

Tech Stack
This project was built from scratch using a modern, lightweight tech stack:

HTML5: For the core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: For a responsive, utility-first design system.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all DOM manipulation, event handling, and application logic.

Google Gemini API: For the live AI idea generation feature, accessed via a fetch request.

Purpose & Value
The goal of this project is to move beyond a traditional resume or portfolio and provide tangible proof of skill. It demonstrates:

Full-Stack Thinking: The ability to architect a solution from the ground up, from UI/UX design to frontend logic and API integration.

Problem-Solving: The tool directly addresses a common pain point for small businesses: a lack of marketing ideas.

Modern Development Skills: It showcases proficiency in building responsive, interactive web applications with modern tools and APIs.
